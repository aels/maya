# maya
Linux ELF Anti-tamper, anti-exploitation. Prototype from 2014. No longer maintained.
Target binaries: ET_EXEC ELF binaries only.

Maya uses a relocatable runtime engine 'tracer.o' which is ultimately linked into the
protected binary. This is the heart of the runtime decryption, obfuscation, nanomites, etc.
